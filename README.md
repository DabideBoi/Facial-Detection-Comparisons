# Facial-Detection-Comparisons
This is a performance comparison between MediaPipe and Caffe face dection models


## face_detection.py
This face detection utilizes the MediaPipe model in which plots points on the face and draws a box as well

## face_detection_1.py
This python file uses the Caffe Model. It may be tricky to start this one, but the instructions on how to properly run it is commented inside the file.

Hope you guys have a nice day.
